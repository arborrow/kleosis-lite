2 - Kleosis module installation: Download kleosis-lite.zip file from https://github.com/kendev/kleosis-lite
    - Unzip into the following folder: ...'yourdrupal'/sites/all/modules
    - Next, the Kleosis Bartik theme should be installed:
	- Move the folder '_unzip_and_move_me.zip' to a temporary location outside of the kleosis root folder and then unzip it.  Then, move
	  the kleosis_bartik folder into the ../sites/all/themes folder.
	  Now, enable the Kleosis Bartik theme and set it as the default theme as follows: select Appearance from the Administration Menu, 
	  then click on the 'Enable and set default' link under the Kleosis Bartik 7.x theme.  
	  The Kleosis Bartik theme has been modified to allow a wider width in the content area to avoid wrapping of some output data rows.
	  Note - on Linux systems, be sure the appropriate permissions are set for the kleosis_bartik folder and files to insure proper theme display.    
    - Kleosis will be installed next as a Drupal module
    - Select Modules from the Administration menu and scroll down to the Kleosis fieldset area
    - Check all Kleosis checkboxes in the modules list and save the configuration (this may take a few minutes)
    - Create a Main Menu item that links to Kleosis: 
      - Select Structure, Menus, Main Menu from the Administration menu, then select 'add link'
	  Menu link title: Kleosis
	  Path: kleosis
	  (Parent menu link should be set to the Main menu)
	  Weight: initially set this to 2 - can change later to reposition the Kleosis tab
	  Title (or Description): Student Info System
	  
    - Kleosis will show up as a Main Menu item that points to an information page.  The Kleosis menu will be added to this page: 
	- Select Structure, Blocks menu item from the Administration menu, scroll down and click on the configure link accross from the Disabled Kleosis menu
	- In the Kleosis Bartik (default theme) select box, select Sidebar first
	- In the 'Show block on specific pages' section, click on the 'Only the listed pages' radio button and then enter the following two lines in the textarea:
		kleosis
		kleosis/*		
	- Click on Save block and the Kleosis menu will now be shown only on the main Kleosis page and subpages

    - Sample data: The description tables in Kleosis must be populated next and currently this is not done automatically during install. To populate the tables:
    	- From the Kleosis main menu, select Processes and then select the Sample Data tab.
    	- Click on the Populate description tables button

    - Configure Kleosis:
    	- Select Configuration from the Administration Menu, then select the Kleosis settings link
	- Enter in or select settings such as:
		- Organization
		- Academic Year and Term
		- Starting day of week
	- Then enter info (or use defaults if not connecting to Moodle) for the following fields:
		- The url to your Moodle instance
		- Moodle version
		- Moodle default username
		- Moodle password for default username
	- Other configuration settings should be entered now as well:
		- Number of rows displayed by the pager
		- Scheduled Breaks (select 00 for each if no breaks)
	- Save the configuration and close the Kleosis settings overlay page
	
    - Sample school setup (Optional): 
        - From the Kleosis main menu, select Processes and then select the Sample Data tab.
    	- Click on the Load sample data button (this data can be removed later).
    	
If all goes well, Kleosis is now operational.  If the sample data was loaded, select the Kleosis, Students menu item to view a list of students.

Kleosis contains numerous LMS Direct blocks that provide information from Moodle. See instructions below for adding these blocks to any page.


3 - Moodle installation: Instructions are found in the INSTALL.txt file from the moodle download file: http://download.moodle.org
    Use those instructions to install Moodle.  Ater sucessful installation, the webservices layer can be installed next:	
	
4 - Webservices installation: Instructions are found in the README file from the webservices download file: https://github.com/patrickpollet/moodlews
    Use those instructions to install OK Tech Webservices. This is summary of steps for Moodle 2.x:

    1) unzip the patrickpollet-moodlews-'commitnumber'.zip into your main Moodle installation folder(this will create a folder named wspp)

    2) copy the additional wspp folder located inside the ..yourmoodle/wspp/local folder into ..yourmoodle/local folder.
       example: yourmoodle/wspp/local/wspp  --->  yourmoodle/local/wspp

    3) click on the Moodle Site administration, Notifications link to complete the installation

    4) you should get a new configuration screen named OK Tech Webservices (aka wspp) inside the Site Adminstration/Development block

Optional Kleosis configuration: add a My Courses - LMS Direct block to an existing page on your website 
    (or create a basic page with the title "My Portal" and add it as a link from the Main Menu. Then:

    - Select Structure, Blocks from the Administration Menu and scroll down to see the LMS Direct Blocks
    - Select configure for the My Courses LMS Direct block
	
	- Select Sidebar second from the default theme select box
	Click the "Only the listed pages" radio button and type the name of the basic page you just created (or your page of choice).		
	*Note*: it's very important that you not show LMS Direct blocks all pages of your site.  
		Since there is a latency associated with connectivity thru the webservices layer to Moodle from these blocks, 
		you probably don't want this latency on all of your site pages!
	- Click on Save Block and exit the Blocks page
	- Navigate to the new page and click on a courses link in the My Course block

That's it!  To help get started using Kleosis, take a look at the Getting Started page of the Kleosis documentation: 
http://www.kleosis.org/kleosisdocs/index.php/Getting_Started. Be sure to set permissions so that instructors can access student info and take attendance.  
Also, if you didn't load the sample data, try creating a basic page first and setting it as your front page.

Have fun and please send us feedback at kleosis.org
