Install notes (12 Nov 2011):

- Install the prerequisite Drupal contributed modules*
- Install Kleosis as a normal Drupal module

	- Create a Main Menu item that links to Kleosis 
		- Select Structure, Menus, Main Menu from the Administration menu, then select 'add link'
			Menu link title: Kleosis
			Path: kleosis
			Description: Student Info System
			(Parent link should already be set to Main menu)
			Weight: use default or set to a preferred number

	- Kleosis then shows up as a Main Menu item that points to an information page. Next, add the Kleosis menu to this page
		- Select Structure, Blocks menu item from the Administration menu and set the Kleosis menu (block) to sidebar first region - be sure to show the block on these listed pages: kleosis and kleosis/*
		
- The OKTech webservices code needs to be intalled on the Moodle instance you will connect to.  This is a separate installation step, and instructions to do this can be found at: http://cipcnet.insa-lyon.fr/Members/ppollet/public/moodlews/  or at https://github.com/patrickpollet/moodlews
Click on INSTALL for the install procedures.  This webservices code works for both Moodle 1.9.x and Moodle 2.x.
  
- Kleosis comes with a recent version of OKTech's webservices client code, and the following configuration info is required to point to the Moodle instance you will connect to:

	- Select Configuration from the Administration Menu, then select the Kleosis settings link
	- Enter in (or use defaults) for the following fields:
		- The url to your Moodle instance
		- Moodle version
		- Moodle default username
		- Moodle password for default username
	Other configuration settings should be entered now as well such as:
		- Academic Year and Term
		- Startng day of week
		- Number of rows displayed by the pager
		- Scheduled Breaks (select 00 for each if no breaks)
	- Save the configuration
		
If all goes well, Kleosis is now fully operational.  Select the Kleosis, Students menu item to get a list of students from the sample data created during install. Then Select the Kleosis/LMS Direct and the 'List Roles' menu tab for a quick test of Moodle connectivity.

Optionally, add a My Courses - LMS Direct block to an existing page on your website (or create a basic page with the title "My Portal" and add it as a link from the Main Menu. Then:

	- Select Structure, Blocks from the Administration Menu and scroll down to see the LMS Direct Blocks
	- Select configure for the My Courses LMS Direct block
	
		- Select Sidebar second from the default theme select box
		- Click the "Only the listed pages" radio button and type the name of the basic page you just created (or your page of choice).		
		*Note*: it's very important that you not show LMS Direct blocks all pages of your site.  Since there is a latency associated with connectivity thru the webservices layer to Moodle from these blocks, you probably don't want this latency on all of your site pages!
		- Click on Save Block and exit the Blocks page
		- Navigate to the new page and click on a courses link in the My Course block

	- ctools
